This Application is just for learning flutter from the flutter course on https://www.appbrewery.co/ which was also available on https://flutter.dev/ for some time. This is one of the finished application in the course. Course reference: https://www.appbrewery.co/p/intro-to-flutter

## How to run
1. Import this repo in android studio(You may use Android Studio> New> Project from Version Control> Git)
2. When the project opens up in android studio you will get a banner which will state 'Pub get has not been run' with options to get dependencies, upgrade dependencies, ignore. Click on get dependencies to install all the dependencies
3. Run the project using run in android studio on either device via USB debugging or by running it on a AVD.

Note: All the boiler plate code was provided by https://www.appbrewery.co and later on with the help of the flutter course on https://www.appbrewery.co additional code was added which made this app functional along with UI. All the credit goes to https://www.appbrewery.co for providing a great boiler plate code along with tutorials on how to build this application in the course.
